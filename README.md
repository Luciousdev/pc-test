## Info

### Support

| OS | Support |
|---|---|
| Windows 10/11 | ‚ö†Ô∏è * |
| Manjaro/Arch | ‚úÖ |
| Ubuntu/Debian | ‚úÖ |
| MacOS | üöß ** |

\* CPU temp still bugged on Windows, you'll have to modify the code yourself for it to work.

\** State of MacOS is currently unknown, looking for people to test it. If you have a Mac and want to contribute, shoot me a message on [discord]

Note: You can find more issues under the [Known-issues](#issues) tab.

### Packages

List of all packages:
| Name | Version |
|---|---|
| psutil | 5.9.5 |
| py-cpuinfo | 9.0.0 |
| matplotlib | 3.7.1 |
| GPUtil | 1.4.0 |

These packages can be easily installed with pip. (look at the install guid for more details.)

### What-it-does

This script will gather basic data about the system and will run a small CPU benchmark to measure the temperatures. (More details can be found under the "Output" section.)

## Guides

### Install-guide

Install at least python 3.10 or above. Versions below that will most likely work but those haven't been tested and thus aren't fully supported.

1. Download/git clone the repository. (You can also get the versions from the [RELEASES](https://github.com/Luciousdev/pc-test/releases) tab)
2. pip install the requirements (Make sure your terminal session is in the downloaded folder.):
    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3. Then you should be able to run the code with this command:
   ```
   python get-data.py
   ```

### How-to-use-the-program&default-settings

To use the script you can launch it with this command:
```
python get-data.py
```
When launching the program it will prompt you on if you'd like to customize the benchmark. The settings it will ask you to change are the CPU utilization (in %) and the total run time (in seconds).
These are the default settings:

| Run time  | CPU utilization  | Drop off time |
|---|---|---|
| 120 Seconds | 100%  | 60 Seconds |

#### Output

Small list of the output it will generate for you:
    - Benchmark results. (CPU temperature max, avg, min)
    - CPU drop off temperature after benchmark in a graph.
    - Battery status.
    - Basic specification about hte system.
    - List all and total running processes with the CPU usage and RAM usage. 
    - System info.
    - When the report is generated.
    
There are example reports for [WINDOWS](https://examples.luciousdev.nl/windows/) and for [LINUX](https://examples.luciousdev.nl/linux/), if you're interested in seeing the results before using the program.

## issues

- Temperature readings on windows are currently not working. (currently working on support.)
- Temperature readings on linux can be a bit buggy.
